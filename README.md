And so we begin FreeCodeCamp
i've wanted to do something like this for a while. I'm a journalist who started messing with html & css a few years ago, then some JavaScript. Tho years went by. Now I hardly do any writing, just coding, still at the same newspaper. I know some stuff, but now I want to learn in a better way, taking a path instead of just doing this and that and look a squiriel.
